Labs and assignments of COMP1927(the new course code shall be COMP2521)

All the files are just ideas for the course, and the requirements may change. Please don't just copy the entire code and submit them, that will not help you to learn.

As some work were done extremely close to the deadline, some code may not be perfect, but I've tried my best to keep a balance between speed and quality. I'd like to hear any suggestions for improvement.

Thanks for reading and may the force be with you ; )
